# Normal Mode

The user invoked `/normal`, meaning: exit CaptureOS Capture Mode for this session.

## Behavior

1. Stop treating every short message as a capture by default.
2. Return to normal assistant behavior: answer, reason, code, research, or act based on explicit requests.
3. Still recognize explicit capture/calendar language such as `Capture:`, `Task:`, `Reminder:`, `Meeting:`, `Event:`, `Idea:`, or `Process this:`.
4. If the user later invokes `/capture`, resume Capture Mode.
